- **Adaptive positioning**: Milestones positioned accurately along the timeline
- **Legend and summary stats**: Clear understanding of progress

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Created/Modified
1. `JourneyPathVisualization.jsx` - New journey path component
2. `timeHorizonUtils.js` - Time horizon calculations and content
3. `GrowthPotentialDashboard.jsx` - Growth phase specialized dashboard
4. `OptimizationDashboard.jsx` - Optimization phase specialized dashboard
5. `RetirementReadinessDashboard.jsx` - Validation phase specialized dashboard
6. `Dashboard.jsx` - Updated to use adaptive layouts

### Adaptive Content System
- **Time horizon calculation**: Determines which phase user is in
- **Dynamic content**: Messages, colors, and emphasis adapt to phase
- **Layout switching**: Different component hierarchies for each phase

## User Experience Improvements

### Personalized Messaging
- **Growth phase**: "Time is your superpower" - inspiring and motivational
