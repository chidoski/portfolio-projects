# Dream Planner MVP - Reimagining Retirement Planning for the Modern Generation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Dream Planner transforms traditional retirement planning into an engaging, achievable journey by meeting users where they are today. Instead of focusing on a distant retirement date 30-40 years away, we help users plan for their dreams in 5, 10, and 15-year increments while building sustainable financial habits.

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

Traditional retirement planning fails the 25-45 age demographic because:
- It feels impossibly distant and abstract
- Current financial pressures (student loans, housing costs, childcare) make traditional savings rates feel unattainable
- Generic advice doesn't account for modern career patterns (gig economy, career changes, entrepreneurship)
- The connection between today's actions and future outcomes is unclear

## 💡 Our Solution: The Dream Planner Approach

We reframe retirement planning as "dream planning" with three core innovations:

1. **Progressive Goal Architecture**: Start with achievable near-term dreams (1-3 years), building toward medium-term (5-10 years) and long-term goals (15+ years)
2. **Behavioral Finance Integration**: Weekly micro-goals that compound into monthly achievements and quarterly milestones
3. **Adaptive Planning Engine**: Adjusts recommendations based on life changes, not rigid 40-year projections

- **Smart Goal Decomposition**: Breaks large dreams into weekly/monthly/quarterly targets
