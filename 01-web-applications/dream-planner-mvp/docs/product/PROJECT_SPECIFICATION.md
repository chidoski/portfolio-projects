# Dream Planner - Project Specification

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Transform retirement planning from a distant, anxiety-inducing obligation into an engaging journey of achieving progressive life dreams, making financial security feel attainable and exciting for the 25-45 demographic.

### Mission
Empower modern workers to build wealth through dream-based goal setting, behavioral nudges, and celebration of progress, not deprivation.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Dream Timeline™
Instead of a single "retirement at 65" goal, users create a timeline of dreams:
- **Near Dreams** (1-3 years): That course, vacation, or experience
- **Growth Dreams** (3-7 years): Home down payment, sabbatical, starting a business
- **Freedom Dreams** (7-15 years): Financial independence milestones
- **Legacy Dreams** (15+ years): Traditional retirement reimagined

### 2. The Progress Pyramid™
Every dream breaks down into:
```
Dream (e.g., $30,000 for sabbatical in 5 years)
    ↓
Yearly Targets ($6,000/year)
    ↓
Quarterly Milestones ($1,500/quarter)
    ↓
Monthly Goals ($500/month)
    ↓
Weekly Habits ($125/week)
    ↓
Daily Decisions (~$18/day)
```

### 3. The Celebration System
- **Micro-wins**: Daily savings streaks
- **Milestone Moments**: Monthly goal achievements
- **Dream Progress**: Quarterly assessments
- **Life Levels**: Annual wealth building stages
