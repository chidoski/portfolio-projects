# User Stories - Dream Planner MVP

## Overview

These user stories provide concrete scenarios for implementation, helping you understand not just what to build but why each feature matters to real users. Each story includes acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and emotional design considerations to ensure the final product resonates with users on both practical and emotional levels.

## Epic 1: First-Time User Onboarding

### Story 1.1: Dream Discovery
**As a** skeptical first-time visitor  
**I want to** explore what dreams are possible  
**So that** I feel inspired about my financial future rather than anxious

**Scenario:**
Sarah, 32, arrives at Dream Planner after years of avoiding retirement planning. She's immediately asked "What would you do if money wasn't the obstacle?" Instead of forms and calculations, she sees beautiful images of real dreams: a sabbatical in Portugal, starting a coffee shop, taking a year to write a novel. She thinks, "Maybe this is different."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Landing page loads in under 2 seconds with inspiring imagery
- User can browse dream gallery without creating account
- At least 12 dream examples across 6 categories are visible
- Each dream shows estimated cost and timeline
- User can click any dream to see how it breaks down into daily amounts
- Copy emphasizes possibility, not restriction

**Implementation Notes:**
The dream gallery should use high-quality, aspirational imagery that evokes emotion. Include diverse dreams that appeal to different life stages and interests. Implement smooth parallax scrolling or subtle animations that make browsing feel premium. Pre-calculate common dream amounts to show instantly without backend calls.

**Emotional Design Considerations:**
The first 10 seconds determine whether Sarah continues or leaves. The visuals should trigger "I want that" feelings. The copy should acknowledge that traditional planning feels impossible while promising a better way. Avoid any language that implies judgment about current financial situation.

### Story 1.2: Personal Dream Creation
**As a** newly inspired user  
**I want to** add my own specific dreams to a timeline  
**So that** I see my personal future taking shape

**Scenario:**
Marcus, excited by the examples, wants to add his three dreams: paying off student loans, taking his kids to Disney World, and eventually starting a design studio. He adds each dream with a photo, amount, and preferred timeline. As he adds them, they appear on a beautiful timeline showing how they layer over the coming years. Suddenly his vague anxieties become a concrete, achievable plan.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can add dream with title, amount, date, and photo in under 60 seconds
- Photo upload accepts common formats and provides fallback gallery
- Timeline updates in real-time as dreams are added
- Dreams automatically arrange chronologically
- User can drag to adjust dream dates and see impact
- Save happens automatically without explicit action needed

**Implementation Notes:**
Implement optimistic updates so dreams appear instantly on the timeline. Use a carousel or grid for the photo gallery with categories. The timeline should support both horizontal scrolling and zoom levels. Include subtle animations when dreams are added or repositioned.

### Story 1.3: The Achievability Moment
**As a** user who just added an intimidating dream  
**I want to** see it broken into manageable pieces  
**So that** I believe I can actually achieve it

**Scenario:**
Sarah just added her $30,000 sabbatical dream for 5 years from now. The number feels impossible until the screen transforms, showing: "That's just $16 per day" with comparisons: "One lunch out" or "Three fancy coffees." A slider lets her adjust the timeline to see how waiting one more year drops it to $13 per day. She realizes she spends more than that on unused subscriptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Breakdown appears within 500ms of dream creation
- Shows daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly amounts
- Includes at least 3 relatable comparisons
- Slider adjusts timeline with real-time amount updates
- Shows impact of compound interest (adding 5% returns)
- Includes "start today vs. wait a year" comparison

**Implementation Notes:**
Pre-calculate common ranges to prevent calculation delays. Use smooth number transitions when amounts change. Include a variety of comparisons relevant to different lifestyles. The compound interest calculation should be transparent with a tooltip explanation.

## Epic 2: Building Momentum

### Story 2.1: First Week Commitment
**As a** motivated new user  
**I want to** commit to my first week's savings goal  
**So that** I start building momentum immediately

**Scenario:**
Marcus is ready to start but worried about overcommitting. The app suggests starting with just $50 this week across all his dreams. He can adjust up or down, seeing how it affects his timeline. He chooses $75, feeling ambitious but realistic. The app celebrates: "Your journey to three amazing dreams starts now!" He gets his first achievement badge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System suggests initial amount based on dreams and timeline
- User can adjust via slider or direct input
- Visual feedback shows impact on each dream
- Confirmation triggers celebration animation
- First achievement unlocks immediately
- Week's targets are clearly displayed

**Implementation Notes:**
The suggested amount should err on the conservative side to ensure early success. Include multiple celebration levels based on ambition. The achievement system should have visual and audio feedback (if enabled). Store the commitment locally to persist across sessions.

### Story 2.2: Daily Check-ins
**As an** engaged user during my first week  
**I want to** see my daily progress  
**So that** I stay motivated and aware

**Scenario:**
Tuesday morning, Sarah gets a gentle notification: "Good morning! Today's $16 moves you one day closer to Portugal. You're doing great!" Opening the app, she sees she's saved $32 so far this week, with a progress bar filling toward her $112 weekly goal. A small calendar shows check marks for Monday and Tuesday.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Optional daily notifications at user-chosen time
- Progress bar shows real-time status vs. weekly goal
- Calendar view highlights successful days
- Encouraging message varies daily
- Can log actual amount saved if different from plan
- Shows cumulative progress toward all dreams

**Implementation Notes:**
Notification messages should rotate through a variety to prevent staleness. The progress bar should fill smoothly with subtle animation. Include quick-log buttons for common amounts. The calendar should be glanceable, not requiring interaction.

### Story 2.3: Handling Life's Realities
**As a** user who missed this week's goal  
**I want to** adjust without feeling ashamed  
**So that** I don't give up entirely

**Scenario:**
Marcus had an unexpected car repair and only saved $20 of his $75 goal. Friday's check-in says: "Life happens! You still saved $20 this week - that's $20 closer to your dreams than last week. Ready to reset for next week?" He can choose to make up the difference next week, extend his timeline slightly, or just start fresh. No judgment, just options.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System detects when goal won't be met by Thursday
- Offers adjustment options without shame language
- Can redistribute missed amount across future weeks
- Can extend timeline to maintain weekly amounts
- Can mark week as "exception" without penalty
- Next week starts fresh regardless of this week

**Implementation Notes:**
The tone here is crucial - supportive, not judgmental. Avoid red colors or negative icons. Frame missed goals as learning experiences. Include a "life event" tag option for context. Don't break streaks for single missed weeks if user logs reason.

## Epic 3: Sustained Engagement

### Story 3.1: Monthly Milestone Celebration
**As a** user completing my first month  
**I want to** see and celebrate my accumulated progress  
**So that** I feel proud and motivated to continue

**Scenario:**
Sarah completes her first month having saved $380 of her planned $450. The app celebrates with a full-screen animation: "Amazing! You've saved $380 in your first month! That's 84% of your goal and you're already 1.2% of the way to Portugal!" She sees a visual showing her dream 1.2% filled, plus metrics like "15 successful days" and "3-week streak."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Month-end triggers automatic celebration screen
- Shows total saved, percentage of goal, and progress to each dream
- Includes positive metrics even if goal not fully met
- Visual representation of progress on each dream
- Can share achievement (optional)
- Suggests next month's goal based on performance

**Implementation Notes:**
The celebration should feel significant with full-screen takeover and rich animations. Focus on what was achieved, not what was missed. Include a variety of metrics so everyone has something to celebrate. Make sharing easy but not pushy.

### Story 3.2: Dream Evolution
**As a** user whose circumstances have changed  
**I want to** adjust my dreams without starting over  
**So that** my plan stays relevant to my life

**Scenario:**
Marcus gets a promotion with a 15% raise. He wants to accelerate his studio dream and add a new dream of family vacation to Hawaii. The app lets him redistribute his increased capacity, showing how he could achieve his studio 18 months earlier or keep the timeline and reduce weekly amounts. He adjusts everything in minutes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can edit any dream's amount, date, or details
- System recalculates all goals automatically
- Shows before/after timeline comparison
- Can add new dreams that integrate with existing ones
- Can pause dreams temporarily without deletion
- History tracks changes for reference

**Implementation Notes:**
Make it clear that adjusting dreams is normal and encouraged. Show the impact of changes visually before confirming. Maintain history so users can see their journey evolution. Allow bulk adjustments for income changes.

### Story 3.3: Progress Insights
**As a** user after three months  
**I want to** understand my patterns and opportunities  
**So that** I can optimize my savings strategy

**Scenario:**
After three months, Sarah reviews her insights: "You save 40% more on weeks you check in daily" and "Your most successful day is Monday - consider automatic transfers." She sees that she's ahead on her Portugal dream but behind on her home down payment. The app suggests redistributing $10 weekly to balance progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Insights generate after 12 weeks of data
- Shows patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful weeks
- Identifies optimal days/times for saving
- Compares progress across different dreams
- Suggests specific, actionable optimizations
- Updates monthly with new patterns

**Implementation Notes:**
Use simple analytics to find genuine patterns, not generic advice. Make insights actionable with specific numbers. Visualize patterns with simple charts. Allow dismissal of insights that don't apply.

## Epic 4: Achievement and Continuation

### Story 4.1: First Dream Achieved
**As a** user achieving my first dream  
**I want to** celebrate appropriately  
**So that** I feel the full satisfaction of my accomplishment

**Scenario:**
Marcus achieves his Disney World dream after 8 months. The app transforms into celebration mode with confetti, shows a retrospective of his journey including total saved and weeks of effort, and prompts him to upload photos from the trip later. It then asks: "You've proven you can achieve dreams. What's next?" suggesting new dreams based on his proven savings velocity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Achievement triggers special celebration sequence
- Shows journey statistics and timeline
- Prompts for photos/story (optional)
- Suggests next dreams based on proven capacity
- Maintains record in achievement gallery
- Can share success story

**Implementation Notes:**
This moment should feel truly special with premium animations and sound. Create a shareable story format. Calculate accurate capacity based on historical performance. Make the transition to new dreams seamless.

### Story 4.2: Building Wealth Habits
**As a** user who has been saving for 6 months  
**I want to** see my habits becoming automatic  
**So that** I recognize my transformation

**Scenario:**
Sarah notices she no longer needs daily reminders. The app recognizes this: "You've checked in 24 weeks in a row. You've built a wealth-building habit! Want to switch to weekly summaries instead of daily nudges?" Her profile shows "Wealth Builder Level 3" with statistics about her transformation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System recognizes habit formation patterns
- Offers to adjust notification frequency
- Shows level/status progression
- Displays habit statistics

## Epic 5: Social and Community Features (Post-MVP)

### Story 5.1: Dream Inspiration Sharing
**As a** successful user  
**I want to** inspire others with my achieved dreams  
**So that** I help others believe it's possible

**Scenario:**
Sarah returns from Portugal and wants to share her success. She creates a brief story with photos and key stats: "Saved for 18 months, worth every penny!" This appears in the community inspiration feed, helping others visualize their own dreams. She gets messages from users saying her story motivated them.

- Others can "heart" or save for inspiration

## Implementation Priority for MVP

For Monday's demo, focus on implementing stories in this priority order to ensure a compelling demonstration even if not all stories are complete. First, implement the complete Dream Discovery and Personal Dream Creation flow, as this establishes the core value proposition and emotional hook that will resonate with the CEO. Next, build the Achievability Moment feature, as this demonstrates the key insight of making large goals feel manageable. Then create the First Week Commitment flow to show how users begin their journey with achievable goals. If time permits, add Daily Check-ins to demonstrate ongoing engagement, and finally implement Monthly Milestone Celebration to show the full cycle of user success.

Remember that each story represents a real person with real anxieties about money. The success of Dream Planner depends not just on calculating numbers correctly, but on making users feel empowered, celebrated, and capable of achieving their dreams. Every implementation decision should consider both the functional requirement and the emotional impact on the user.
