# Product Requirements Document - Dream Planner MVP

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

The traditional approach to retirement planning creates a psychological barrier that prevents the 25-45 age demographic from building wealth effectively. When financial advisors present retirement as a single event forty years in the future requiring millions of dollars, it triggers avoidance behavior rather than action. This generation faces unique financial pressures including student debt, delayed homeownership, and career volatility that make traditional planning models feel impossible.

Our research reveals that this demographic doesn't lack the desire to save; they lack a framework that makes saving feel achievable and rewarding in the present while building toward the future. They need a system that acknowledges their current reality while progressively building financial security.

### Solution Approach

Dream Planner reimagines financial planning as a journey of achieving progressive life dreams rather than saving for a distant retirement. By breaking down large financial goals into weekly habits and celebrating progress along the way, we transform saving from deprivation into achievement. The product uses behavioral psychology principles to create sustainable financial habits through positive reinforcement rather than restriction.

## Core User Flows

### Onboarding Flow: From Skeptic to Believer

The onboarding experience must convert a skeptical user into an engaged planner within five minutes. The flow progressively builds emotional investment before requesting any sensitive information.

**Step 1: Inspiration (30 seconds)**
The user lands on a warm, inviting screen that asks "What dreams would you pursue if money wasn't the obstacle?" They see beautiful visualizations of common dreams like traveling through Europe, starting a business, or taking a sabbatical. This immediately reframes the conversation from retirement to dreams.

**Step 2: Dream Selection (60 seconds)**
The user selects or inputs three dreams across different time horizons. The interface shows these dreams on a timeline, making them feel tangible and achievable. Each dream can include a photo, either uploaded or selected from a curated gallery, creating emotional connection.

**Step 3: Reality Check (45 seconds)**
Without requiring exact numbers, the user provides general information about their age and income range. The system then shows how their dreams translate into daily, weekly, and monthly savings targets. The key insight here is showing that their seemingly impossible dream requires just $15 per day or skipping three coffee purchases weekly.

**Step 4: First Commitment (90 seconds)**
The user sets their first weekly savings goal based on what feels achievable, not what's optimal. They can adjust a slider to see how different amounts affect their timeline. The system celebrates any commitment, even if it's just $20 per week, reinforcing that starting is more important than perfection.

**Step 5: Celebration Setup (60 seconds)**
The user chooses how they want to be encouraged, selecting from morning motivation, evening check-ins, or weekly summaries. They also set their preferred celebration style, from subtle progress updates to enthusiastic achievement animations. The flow ends with their first achievement unlocked: "Dream Journey Begun."

### Weekly Engagement Flow: The Progress Pulse

The weekly check-in maintains momentum without becoming burdensome. It takes less than two minutes and focuses on celebration and adjustment rather than judgment.

**Monday Morning Prompt:**
The user receives a notification: "Ready to move $35 closer to Japan this week?" Opening the app shows their current week's target with a simple question: "Feeling confident about this week's goal?" They can tap yes to confirm or adjust if circumstances have changed.

**Mid-Week Encouragement:**
On Wednesday, the app provides context: "You're 40% toward this week's goal! That's already two days closer to your dream than you were on Monday." This reframing makes progress feel significant even mid-week.

**Friday Victory Lap:**
If the user has met their goal, the app celebrates with their chosen style of recognition. If they haven't, it reframes: "You saved $20 this week. That's $20 more toward your dreams. Ready to restart fresh next week?"

**Sunday Planning:**
The app prompts: "Next week you could be $35 closer to Japan, or $50 if you're feeling ambitious. What feels right?" This forward-looking prompt maintains momentum regardless of the previous week's performance.

### Dream Achievement Flow: The Milestone Moment

When users achieve dreams, the experience must feel significant and encourage setting new dreams.

**Achievement Recognition:**
The interface transforms to celebration mode with confetti, animations, and a showcase of the achieved dream. The user sees a retrospective of their journey including total saved, time taken, and key milestones along the way.

**Story Creation:**
The app prompts the user to create a victory story with photos and reflections that can be shared or kept private. This reinforces the positive emotions associated with disciplined saving.

**Next Dream Activation:**
Rather than leaving a void, the app immediately suggests: "You've proven you can achieve dreams. What's next?" It shows how their developed habits could achieve even more ambitious dreams using their now-proven savings velocity.

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have Features (MVP)

#### Dream Builder
The dream builder allows users to create and visualize their financial goals in an emotionally resonant way. Users can add dreams with titles, descriptions, target amounts, and target dates. Each dream can include an inspirational image, either uploaded or selected from a curated gallery organized by category. The system automatically suggests reasonable timelines based on the amount and offers three savings velocity options: relaxed, balanced, and ambitious.

The interface must show dreams on an interactive timeline that users can scroll through, seeing how their dreams stack from present to future. The timeline should feel inspiring rather than overwhelming, with smooth animations and beautiful visualizations that make the future feel exciting rather than distant.

#### Intelligent Calculator
The calculator transforms intimidating large numbers into manageable daily actions. When a user inputs a dream costing $30,000 in five years, the calculator immediately shows multiple perspectives: save $16 per day, $115 per week, $500 per month, or $6,000 per year. It also shows creative comparisons like "the cost of your daily coffee" or "one meal delivery per week."

The calculator must account for compound interest using conservative 5% returns to avoid over-promising. It should show how starting now versus waiting one year affects the required savings amount, creating urgency without panic. The interface must allow easy adjustment of any variable to see immediate impacts on other values.

#### Progress Dashboard
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of financial progress without overwhelming detail. The main view shows overall progress toward all dreams using a visually appealing progress ring or bar. Each dream has its own card showing current progress, days remaining, and whether the user is on track, ahead, or behind schedule.

The dashboard must offer multiple time views including daily habits, weekly goals, monthly milestones, and quarterly assessments. Users should see their current streak of successful weeks and their best streak to date. The interface celebrates being on track and gently encourages when behind without creating shame.

#### Behavioral Nudge System
The nudge system provides timely encouragement without becoming annoying. Morning nudges remind users what today's savings accomplish: "Today's $16 is one more day in Japan." Evening nudges celebrate success or encourage reset: "You chose your future today. Sleep well knowing you're building something amazing."

The system must be intelligent enough to vary messages to prevent staleness. It should recognize patterns like consistent success or recent struggles and adjust tone accordingly. Users must have complete control over frequency and timing of nudges with easy options to pause during vacations or difficult periods.

### Should Have Features (Next Iteration)

#### Smart Insights Engine
Analyzes spending patterns to suggest personalized savings opportunities without requiring full budgeting. The engine identifies patterns like "You could save $200 monthly by dining out twice less per week" presented as choices rather than restrictions.

#### Goal Collaboration
Allows partners or family members to work toward shared dreams together. Each person can contribute at their own pace while seeing combined progress. This creates accountability and shared celebration opportunities.

#### Achievement Gallery
A visual showcase of all achieved dreams with photos, stories, and statistics. Users can share achievements publicly for inspiration or keep them private as personal victories. The gallery reinforces that dreams are achievable through consistent action.

### Could Have Features (Future Vision)

#### AI Financial Coach
Conversational AI that answers questions, provides encouragement, and suggests optimizations. The coach would understand context like "I just got a raise" and suggest how to accelerate dreams without lifestyle inflation.

#### Investment Bridge
Once users build basic savings habits, guide them toward appropriate investment vehicles. This would include education about risk, returns, and tax-advantaged accounts, maintaining the same approachable tone as the core product.

#### Social Challenges
Community-driven savings challenges where users work toward similar goals together. Challenges like "Save for Summer Vacation" create motivation through positive peer pressure and shared success.

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design Principles

The design must feel warm and approachable, using gradients and soft colors rather than corporate blues and grays. The aesthetic should evoke possibility and excitement about the future rather than the sterility of traditional financial applications. Think more lifestyle app than banking tool, with magazine-quality photography for dream imagery and smooth, delightful animations that make interactions feel special.

Typography should be modern and readable with clear hierarchy. Headlines use bold, inspiring fonts while body text remains highly legible. Numbers, especially those showing progress or savings amounts, should feel significant and celebratory when displaying achievements.

### Interaction Patterns

Every interaction should provide immediate feedback through micro-animations. When users adjust savings amounts, they see real-time updates to timelines. When they log progress, celebratory animations reinforce positive behavior. The interface should feel responsive and alive, not static and transactional.

Touch targets must be large enough for comfortable mobile use, minimum 44 pixels. Swipe gestures should feel natural for timeline navigation and dream browsing. The interface should minimize typing, using sliders, selections, and smart defaults wherever possible.

### Emotional Design

The product must evoke positive emotions at every touchpoint. Success moments should feel genuinely celebratory with confetti, animations, and encouraging messages. Setbacks should be reframed positively: "You saved something this week, and that's progress" rather than "You missed your goal."

Color psychology should reinforce the emotional journey. Greens for progress and growth, warm oranges and yellows for celebration, soft blues for calm planning moments. Red should be avoided except for critical actions like dream deletion.

## Risks and Mitigations

### User Adoption Risk
Users might not trust a new financial planning approach. Mitigation includes starting with low-commitment goals, showing immediate value through calculations, and building trust through transparency about methods and assumptions.

### Engagement Drop-off Risk
Users might lose interest after initial enthusiasm. Mitigation includes variable reward schedules, progressive feature disclosure, and continuous content freshness through new dream suggestions and challenges.
